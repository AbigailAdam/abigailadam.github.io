    <p>
      This co-op was my first experience working at a large engineering firm responsible for many of the largest and most complex structural engineering projects in the GTA. In this role, I was mostly tasked with research, preparing responses to R.F.Ps (requests for proposals), and helping create and test models to predict rebar consumption on large projects.  
    <p> 
    The research focused on examining the literature on top-down construction. Top-down construction is a method for building skyscrapers that has yet to be widely adopted in Canada. I presented the results of this research to senior partners to be used in pitches to future clients.

# Technion - International Undergraduate Summer Research Program
## July 2024
## Skills
Applied Math - Particle Physics - Work-based Learning
### Description and Outcome
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 20px;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p>
      The International Undergraduate Summer Research Program is run by the Technion each year, and it gives students from around the world the opportuntity to be involved in cutting edge scientific research. 
    <p> 
    I worked with the High Energy Physics Group, supervised by Professor [Yotam Soreq](https://phsites.technion.ac.il/hep/members/yotam-soreq/ "Yotam Soreq"). 
    <p>
    In this role, I learned a lot about particle physics and the applied mathematics involved in Dr. Soreq's work. However, my main task was analyzing the electrical and mechanical functioning of instruments used in high energy physics experiments to evaluate their relevance to Dr. Soreqâ€™s research.

# Design Team - Agroponics UBC
## September 2024 - present
## Skills
Python - C++ - Java
### Description and Outcome
I have been a member of the automation subteam of [Agroponics UBC](https://ubcagroponics.com/ "Agroponics UBC") for a year. 
My role is working on communication between the components of our system. We have several ESP32s and a Raspberry Pi that form a server, hosted on the Raspberry Pi. These elements communicate using the MQTT framework, and will be used to both collect sensor data from the hydroponic system and send out instructions to our actuators.
