<h3>Description and Outcome</h3>

This co-op was my first experience working at a large engineering firm responsible for many of the largest and most complex structural engineering projects in the GTA. In this role, I was mostly tasked with research, preparing responses to R.F.Ps (requests for proposals), and helping create and test models to predict rebar consumption on large projects.  

The research focused on examining the literature on top-down construction. Top-down construction is a method for building skyscrapers that has yet to be widely adopted in Canada. It is much more time and space efficient, and as such has been adopted mostly in highly congested areas throughout Europe and Southeast Asia. It also involves foundation types well suited to weak and silty soils. I presented the results of this research to senior partners to be used in pitches to future clients, as downtown Toronto is growing more congested and the benefits of this method are becoming very significant on large-scale projects. 

I generated the following diagrams showing the development of top down construction projects across the globe:
