<h3>Description and Outcome</h3>
<p> I have been a member of the automation subteam of <a href="https://ubcagroponics.com/" target="_blank" title="Agroponics UBC">Agroponics</a> for a year. Our team's goal is to create a hydroponic system that can be monitored remotely with many of the elements being fully automated. This includes collecting data from our sensors, sending it to our main database, and creating visualisations. We are also creating a control panel other team members can use to alter system parameters (light exposure, the amount of nutrient solution in the water, etc.). 
<p>
My role is working on communication between the components of our system. We have several ESP32s and a Raspberry Pi that form a server, hosted on the Raspberry Pi. These elements communicate using the MQTT framework, and will be used to both collect sensor data from the hydroponic system and send out instructions to our actuators. 
</p>
I also work directly with the sensors, which involves writing code that collects data, designing calibration procedure, and prototyping the associated circuits.
