<h3>Description and Outcome</h3>

The International Undergraduate Summer Research Program is run by the Technion each year, and it gives students from around the world the opportunity to be involved in cutting edge scientific research. 

I worked with the High Energy Physics Group, supervised by Professor  <a href="https://phsites.technion.ac.il/hep/members/yotam-soreq/" target="_blank" title="Yotam Soreq">Yotam Soreq</a>. Their research focuses on theoretical extensions of the standard model. 

I also attended and worked through several masters-level tutorials in particle physics under the supervision of Chaja Baruch, one of Dr. Soreq's PhD students who also works in the High Energy Physics group. The topics I studied included: 
- Special Relativity
- The Standard Model
- Observables in Particle Physics
- Particle Detection Signatures 

Through this, I also learned a lot about particle physics and the applied mathematics involved in Dr. Soreq's work, which involved group theory and learning about tensor calculus. 

My main task was analyzing the electrical and mechanical functioning of instruments used in high energy physics experiments to evaluate their relevance to Dr. Soreq’s research. My main focus was on a paper entitled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13257" target="_blank" title="Mechanical Detection of Nuclear Delays">Mechanical Detection of Nuclear Delays</a>. The paper discusses the design and testing of a device used to detect alpha decays from a radioactive nucleus by embedding it into a larger, micron sized particle and using the mechanical recoil caused by the alpha particle emission to identify a decay. Images of the apparatus can be seen below:
