<h3>Description and Outcome</h3>
<p>
  The Weizmann Institute of Science runs an annual international physics competition in which students build physics puzzle boxes. I participated in this competition in 2023. The objective of the competition is to build a safe that no other team can open, and they are scored on difficulty and the contestant’s understanding of underlying physics principles.

  Our puzzles consisted of two circuits that had to be completed: one required the contestants to drain a Pythagoras cup of salt water into the well, which then completed the first circuit, illuminating one of the two LEDs. The second required shining a light on a photoresistor with a mounted laser through a hedge maze. This required choosing the correct mirrors from those we provided and placing each in the correct position, reflecting the laser onto the photoresistor, illuminating the second LED. </p>

  Our safe won the competition in Canada, qualifying for the international competition held at the headquarters of the Weizmann Institute.
