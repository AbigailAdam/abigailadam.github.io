<h3>Description and Outcome</h3>
<p> In the summer of 2022, I participated in Harvard's Summer School program. As part of that program, I took a course entitled Astronomy: The Life and Death of Stars. In this class, we explored the beginnings of the universe, the life cycle of stars, and the nature of planet formation. </p>
<p>
For my final project, I used publicly available data and software developed by my professor (EXOFASTv2) to model a solar system and verify that there is an exoplanet in it. This is done by analyzing periodic decreases in the detected brightness of the star(s) in the solar system of interest, as these periodic changes are suggestive of something in orbit eclipsing the star. Once a pattern has been identified, the characteristics of these 'transits' can be analysed to determine if the occlusion is caused by an exoplanet, and if so give insight into it's characteristics. </p>
<p>
  After I was satisfied with the model EXOFAST provided, I had to interpret the dozens of graphs the program created and use them to determine the characteristics of the planet and its star. This project culminated in a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xTxBpl6BDuQzn3yw4_8OyXE1H1EhJcpb/view" target="_blank">technical report</a> on the process and findings. 
</p>
<p>
  The system I studied, 253990973, is a binary star system whose exoplanet is tidally locked to the larger, dimmer star.
