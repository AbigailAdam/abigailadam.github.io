      <h3>Description and Outcome</h3>
      <p>
      This project was completed for ENPH 253. In this course, students form teams and build autonomous robots to participate in a competition. The  <a href="https://projectlab.engphys.ubc.ca/enph-253-2025/" target="_blank" title="2025 Competition">2025 competition</a> involved the robots collecting Beanie Babies from various positions along an obstacle course and returning them to a safe zone. </p>
      <p>
      My responsibilities focused on the electrical and software design of our robot. The electrical side 
      involved designing our H-Bridge PCBs, power distribution, and claw integration circuits. For the software, 
      I wrote C++ libraries to communicate and process data from the many sensors we used and control our actuators. The github repo containing 
      the code for the project can be found  <a href="https://github.com/emajkic/ENPH_253_Robot" target="_blank" title="GitHub Repo">here</a>.
