## 2025

### Skills
PCB Design (KiCAD) · Prototyping · C++

### Description and Outcome

This project was completed for ENPH 253. In this course, students form teams and build autonomous robots to participate in a competition. The [2025 Competition](https://projectlab.engphys.ubc.ca/enph-253-2025/) involved the robots collecting Beanie Babies from various positions along an obstacle course and returning them to a safe zone.

My responsibilities focused on the electrical and software design of our robot. The electrical side involved designing our H-Bridge PCBs, power distribution, and claw integration circuits. For the software, I wrote C++ libraries to communicate and process data from the many sensors we used and control our actuators. The github repo containing the code for the project can be found  [here](https://github.com/emajkic/ENPH_253_Robot). 

Here is the schematic of the PCB:
