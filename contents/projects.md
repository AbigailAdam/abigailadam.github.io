        <h2>Exoplanet Characterisation</h2>
        <h3>2022</h3>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>Applied Physics - Simulations - Astronomy</p>
        <h3>Description and Outcome</h3>
        <p> In the summer of 2022, I participated in Harvard's summer school program. As part of that program, I took a course entitled Astronomy: The Life and Death of Stars. In this class, we explored the beginnings of the universe, the life cycle of stars, and the nature of exoplanet detection and planet formation. </p>
          <p>
            For my final project, I used publicly available data and software developed by my professor to model a solar system and verify that there is an
            exoplanet orbiting in it. This is done by analyzing periodic decreases in the detected brightness of stars, as these periodic changes 
            are suggestive of something in orbit eclipsing the star. </p>
          <p>
            After I was satisfied with the model, I had to interpret the dozens of graphs the program created and use them to determine the characteristics of
            the planet and its star. This project involved interacting with software and writing a 
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xTxBpl6BDuQzn3yw4_8OyXE1H1EhJcpb/view" target="_blank">technical report</a>
            on the process and findings. </p>
          <p>
            The system I studied, 253990973, is a binary star system whose exoplanet is tidally locked to the larger, dimmer star.

          <h3>Description and Outcome</h3>
          <p>
            The Weizmann Institute of Science runs an annual international physics competition in which students build 
            physics puzzle boxes. I participated in this competition in 2023. The objective of the competition is to build a 
            safe that no other team can open, and they are scored on difficulty and the contestantâ€™s understanding of 
            underlying physics principles. </p>
          <p>
            Our puzzles consisted of two circuits that had to be completed: one required the contestants to drain a Pythagoras 
            cup of salt water into the well, which then completed the first circuit, illuminating one of the two LEDs. The 
            second required shining a light on a photoresistor with a mounted laser through a hedge maze. This required 
            choosing the correct mirrors from those we provided and placing each in the correct position, reflecting the 
            laser onto the photoresistor, illuminating the second LED. </p>
          <p>
            Our safe won the competition in Canada, qualifying for the international competition held at the 
            headquarters of the Weizmann Institute.

      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p>Circuit Design - Prototyping - Engineering Design</p>
      <h3>Description and Outcome</h3>
      <p>
        For this project, my teammates and I built a solar-powered phone charger that is fully collapsible. I 
        was primarily responsible for the case, which I designed, prototyped, and then 3D printed and assembled. </p>
      <p>
        Despite this, my teammates and I worked closely on every aspect of the project, which involved the circuit 
        design for the panels, programming the display showing their output and monitoring the device, and fabricating 
        the actual folding case. </p>
      <p>
        This project taught me that although work can be divided between team members, one must nonetheless work 
        closely with teammates and understand their work for a project to be successful.

      <p>PCB Design (KiCAD) - Prototyping - C++</p>
      <h3>Description and Outcome</h3>
      <p>
      This project was completed for ENPH 253, otherwise known as Robot Summer. In this course, students form teams and 
      build autonomous robots to participate in a competition. The  <a href="https://projectlab.engphys.ubc.ca/enph-253-2025/" target="_blank" title="2025 Competition">2025 competition</a> involved the robots collecting Beanie Babies from various positions along an obstacle course and returning them to a safe zone. </p>
      <p>
      My responsibilities focused on the electrical and software design of our robot. The electrical side 
      involved designing our H-Bridge PCBs, power distribution, and claw integration circuits. For the software, 
      I wrote C++ libraries to communicate and process data from the many sensors we used and control our actuators. The github repo containing 
      the code for the project can be found  <a href="https://github.com/emajkic/ENPH_253_Robot" target="_blank" title="GitHub Repo">here</a>.
